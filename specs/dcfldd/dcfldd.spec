%description
dcfldd is an enhanced version of GNU dd with features useful for forensics
and security. dcfldd has the following additional features:

   * Hashing on-the-fly - dcfldd can hash the input data as it is being
     transferred, helping to ensure data integrity.
   * Status output - dcfldd can update the user of its progress in terms of
     the amount of data transferred and how much longer operation will take.
   * Flexible disk wipes - dcfldd can be used to wipe disks quickly
     and with a known pattern if desired.
   * Image/wipe Verify - dcfldd can verify that a target drive is a
     bit-for-bit match of the specified input file or pattern.
   * Multiple outputs - dcfldd can output to multiple files or disks at
     the same time.
   * Split output - dcfldd can split output to multiple files with more
     configurability than the split command.
   * Piped output and logs - dcfldd can send all its log data and output
     to commands as well as files natively.
