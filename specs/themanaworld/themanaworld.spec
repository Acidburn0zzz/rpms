%description
The Mana World (TMW) is a serious effort to create an innovative free and
open source MMORPG. It uses 2D graphics and aims to create a large and
diverse interactive world. The game aims to be a unique place for people to
interact not only by fighting each other but to play life, form a community
within the community, or just simply chat. Although the game is never-ending
and a linear story cannot be applied, it should have enough background to
describe and predefine tribes, kingdoms, and the environment overall.
Fullfilled quests should lead to certain events depending on them being
solved. Quests should also encourage teamwork.
