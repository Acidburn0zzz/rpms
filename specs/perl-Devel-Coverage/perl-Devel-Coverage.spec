%description
Devel::Coverage is a coverage analysis tool for Perl code. It is inspired
by several factors, most notable my personal high consideration for the
PureCoverage tool (formerly of PureAtria, now from Rational Software)
and my frustration at finding bugs in my code that were hidden in blocks
that were never reached in test cases. That's what a coverage analysis tool
does-- it shows you what parts of your code were and were not reached over
the course of one or more runs.
