README for 14all.cgi
--------------------

14all.cgi is a CGI script to create html pages and graphics for mrtg.
It's not another index.cgi for the mrtg-created html pages! Instead it
creates everything itself.

To use this script you have to switch from rateup .log files to rrdtool:
1. install rrdtool (install perl-shared with "make site-perl-inst" if possible
2. convert every .log file to .rrd with log2rrd.pl (from mrtg contrib)
3. insert the line "UseRRDTool: Yes" to your mrtg.cfg.
4. make 14all.cgi accessible via your web server. change the path to your
   mrtg.cfg file in the line beginning with "$cfgfile = ..."

14all.cgi parses the mrtg config file (often called mrtg.cfg) and uses
most of the information to create
- main index page: one link for every "Directory[...]: adir"
- group index pages: one for every "Directory..." with small versions
  of the daily graphics
- statistic pages: one for every target with daily/weekly/monthly/yearly
  graphics according to "Suppress[...]: ..."

MRTG does not create any graphics/pictures if you set "UseRRDTool: Yes"!
