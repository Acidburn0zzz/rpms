%description
BitchX is a text mode ircII client.  BitchX features include ANSI
color, easy to use shortcut commands, notify/protection/bot lists, 
mass commands and tools, an extended set of DCC commands and built-in 
CDCC, a link looker, extended scripting functionality, a screen client
which allows you to detach and reattach to an IRC session, and lots of 
help available online (many users, many available scripts and a
dedicated help channel--#BitchX on EFNET).
