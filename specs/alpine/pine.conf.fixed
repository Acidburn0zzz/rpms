# Pine system-wide enforced configuration file - customize as needed
#
# This file holds the system-wide enforced values for pine configuration
# settings. Any values set in it will override values set in the
# system-wide default configuration file (/etc/pine.conf) and
# the user's own configuration file (~/.pinerc).
# For more information on the format of this file, read the
# comments at the top of /etc/pine.conf
