%description
IMMS is an adaptive playlist plug-in for XMMS designed to simplify management
and prioritization of large collections of music.

Some of the key features include:
* Rating and playlist adjustment is done completely transparently to the user.
  IMMS is super easy to use!
* Files are indentified by paths and checksums. Even if you move them they
  still keep their ratings.
* Though mostly "good" songs will be played, ocasionally less popular songs
  will sneak in to give them a chance to earn user's favour.
* IMMS does a better job of shuffling than XMMS. It is able to recognise
  different versions of the same song and not play them in quick succession.
