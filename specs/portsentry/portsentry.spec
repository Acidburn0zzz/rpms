%description
PortSentry is part of the Abacus Project suite of tools. The Abacus 
Project is an initiative to release low-maintenance, generic, and reliable
host based intrusion detection software to the Internet community. More
information can be obtained from http://www.psionic.com. 

PortSentry has a number of options to detect port scans, the purpose of this
is to give an admin a heads up that their host is being probed. There are
similar programs that do this already (klaxon, etc.) We have added a little
twist to the whole idea (auto-blocking), plus extensive support for
stealth scan detection.

PortSentry has four "stealth" scan detection modes. Method one uses a 
pre-defined list of ports to watch over. If someone pokes at them
it activates. The second method is what is called "inverse" port binding, 
where every port under a range is watched *except* for those that the 
system has bound for network daemons when the PortSentry starts or ones that
you've manually excluded. This is a very sensitive way for looking for
port probes, but also the most prone to false alarms.
