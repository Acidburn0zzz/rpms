Build RHEL compatible SRPM's for reposurgeon softwrae.

Reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't want to
let you do, such as editing past comments and metadata and removing commits. It
works with any version control system that can export and import git
fast-import streams, including git, hg, and bzr.
